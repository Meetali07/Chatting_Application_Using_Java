# Chatting_Application_Using_Java
This project is a Java-based chat application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Swing. It enables real-time communication between a client and a server through socket programming. The client application provides a custom-designed chat interface that mimics modern messaging apps. It allows users to type and send messages using a text field and a "Send" button. Messages are displayed in a vertically stacked format, complete with timestamps, and are styled with custom colors and padding. The GUI also includes visual elements like profile pictures, video and phone icons, and an "online" status indicator. The client connects to a server on localhost via a specified port and continuously sends and receives messages using DataOutputStream and DataInputStream. Incoming messages are displayed on the left side of the chat window, while outgoing messages appear on the right. This project demonstrates core concepts of Java networking, multithreading, and user interface design with Swing.
